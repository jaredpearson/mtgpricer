# MTG Pricer
Displays price information about price information for Magic: The Gathering cards from CardKingdom.com. 

The project is broken down into two modules
* `mtgpricer-rip` contains all of the ripping and processing of the price information
* `mtgpricer-web` contains the web UI

## Setup

In order to run the MTG Pricer server, you will need the following:

* JDK 8
* Maven 3.2.2
* Vagrant 1.9

Build the Java application:
```
$ sh build.sh
```

Create the VM's with Vagrant:
```
$ vagrant up
```

After the servers start, the application should be accessible at [http://192.168.37.12:8080/](http://192.168.37.12:8080/).

After making changes to the web application, build the source and provision the server with the compiled assets using:
```
$ sh build.sh && vagrant up web
```

### Database

See the [database readme](mtgpricer-db/README.md) for information on the database.

### Logs

The web server will automatically write information to the logs within the VM. To see the logs:

```
$ vagrant ssh web
$ tail -n 200 -f /var/log/mtgpricer.log
```

### Copy Price Data from Host
When running the site with Vagrant, any site data that is ripped though the web server UI will be saved to a file. When
the VM is destroyed, the data will be removed too. If you want to backup the data, use the command below to copy the 
files from the VM into the host.

```
$ scp vagrant@192.168.37.12:/usr/share/mtgpricer/data/priceData/cardkingdom-*.json data/priceData/
```

When prompted, the default Vagrant password is `vagrant`.

### Debugging
To start the server in debug mode:

```
$ vagrant ssh web
$ sudo su
$ sh /usr/share/mtgpricer/server-stop.sh
$ sh /usr/share/mtgpricer/server-start.sh -d
```

Then use Eclipse to connect a Java Remote Application to `192.168.37.12`, port `8888`.
