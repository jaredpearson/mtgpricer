# MTG Pricer
Displays price information about price information for Magic: The Gathering cards from CardKingdom.com. 

The project is broken down into two modules
* `mtgpricer-rip` contains all of the ripping and processing of the price information
* `mtgpricer-web` contains the web UI

## Setup

In order to run the MTG Pricer server, you will need the following:

* JDK 8
* Maven 3.2.2
* Vagrant 1.9

Build the Java application:
```
$ sh build.sh
```

Create the VM's with Vagrant:
```
$ vagrant up
```

After the servers start, the application should be accessible at [http://192.168.37.12:8080/](http://192.168.37.12:8080/).

After making changes to the web application, build the source and provision the server with the compiled assets using:
```
$ sh build.sh && vagrant up web
```

### Database

See the [database readme](mtgpricer-db/README.md) for information on the database.

### Logs

The web server will automatically write information to the logs within the VM. To see the logs:

```
$ vagrant ssh web
$ tail -n 200 -f /var/log/mtgpricer.log
```
